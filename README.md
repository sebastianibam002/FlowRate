# FlowRate
Use to compute the flow-rate analysis from static chambers and python notebook to see theoretical curves of methane over time at chambers, different volumes and different flow rates (Playground.ipynb).


# How to run the code
Most of the functions are in flow_rate_analysis.py, don't worry too much about using helper.py, it just contain extra functions that can be used if you want to, but not necessary for computing the flow rate. So far up to this version there is no support for PMD data files


1. Have an excel file in the same directory emission_rates.xlsx
2. Check you have the files in Data/Aeris
3. Run in the terminal
    python flow_rate_analysis.py
